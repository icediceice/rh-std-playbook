### New Files for AAP 2.5
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `execution-environment.yml` | Defines the execution environment container |
| `bindep.txt` | System package dependencies |
| `requirements.txt` | Python package dependencies |
| `build-info.yml` | EE build instructions and validation |
| `meta/galaxy.yml` | Collection metadata |
| `AAP-2.5-SETUP-GUIDE.md` | Complete setup guide for AAP 2.5 |

## Inventory Options for AAP 2.5

### 1. Static Inventory with AAP Credentials (`inventory/fortinet_aap.yml`)
- **Best for**: Fixed device lists with known IP addresses
- **Features**: Environment-based grouping, AAP credential integration
- **Usage**: Standard AAP inventory import

### 2. Dynamic Inventory Script (`inventory/fortinet_dynamic.py`)
- **Best for**: Integration with external CMDBs or APIs
- **Features**: Real-time device discovery, environment variable injection
- **Usage**: Executable inventory source in AAP

### 3. Constructed Inventory (`inventory/fortinet_dynamic.yml`)
- **Best for**: Complex grouping and variable composition
- **Features**: Plugin-based inventory with advanced grouping rules
- **Usage**: YAML-based dynamic inventory with plugins

## Credential Management Integration

### AAP Machine Credentials
All playbooks now use AAP machine credentials for authentication:
- **No hardcoded passwords** in playbooks or variables
- **Automatic injection** of `ansible_user` and `ansible_password`
- **Credential rotation** through AAP interface
- **RBAC-controlled** access to credentials

### Group Variables Structure
```
group_vars/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ all/main.yml          # Global defaults for all devices
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production/main.yml   # Production environment settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/main.yml      # Staging environment settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firewalls/main.yml    # Firewall-specific variables
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datacenter_*/main.yml # Location-specific variables
```

### Survey Updates
- **Target selection**: Choose device groups instead of manual host lists
- **No credential prompts**: Credentials automatically injected by AAP
- **Environment-aware**: Surveys adapt to target environment settings

## Features
- **Centralized Host Management:**
  - Manage all Fortinet VA endpoints via `group_vars/fortinet.yml` or the `fortinet_hosts-management-survey.json`.
- **Modular Playbooks:**
  - Each playbook is focused on a specific operational task and uses variables for easy customization.
- **Survey Integration:**
  - All playbooks are compatible with Ansible Tower/AWX surveys for dynamic variable input.
- **Multi-Endpoint Support:**
  - Easily target multiple Fortinet VAs by editing the `fortinet_hosts` variable.

## Playbooks

| Playbook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `connect_fortinet.yml` | Connect and authenticate to Fortinet VA (with encrypted password support). |
| `check_vpn_phase2_status.yml` | Check the status of a specific VPN Phase 2 tunnel. |
| `flush_phase2_tunnel.yml` | Flush all Phase 2 tunnels for a specified VPN. |
| `verify_tcp_application.yml` | Verify application connectivity over TCP/IP. |
| `enable_packet_capture.yml` | Enable packet capture on all interfaces related to a VPN. |
| `flush_tunnel1.yml` | Flush a specific tunnel (Tunnel 1). |
| `check_ike_phase1_status.yml` | Check the status of a specific IKE Phase 1 tunnel. |
| `run_diagnostic.yml` | Run diagnostic commands on Fortinet VA. |
| `notify_admin_tunnel_status.yml` | Send an email notification to admin about tunnel status. |

## Surveys
- Each playbook (except host management) has a matching survey JSON in the `surveys/` directory for variable input.
- Use `fortinet_hosts-management-survey.json` to add or remove Fortinet VA endpoints. This survey always pre-populates the current value for safe editing.

## Usage with AAP 2.5

### 1. Configure Inventory and Credentials
   - **Set up AAP Machine Credential** for Fortinet device access (see [AAP-CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md](AAP-CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md))

### 2. Create and Run Job Templates
   - **Create job templates** in AAP web console pointing to playbooks
   - **Attach machine credentials** to job templates for automatic authentication
   - **Import surveys** from `surveys/` directory for dynamic parameter input
   - **Select target groups** using surveys (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `firewalls`)

### 3. Example Job Template Setup
   ```yaml
   Job Template: "Fortinet - Check VPN Status"
   Inventory: "Fortinet Devices"
   Project: "Fortinet Management" 
   Playbook: "playbooks/check_vpn_phase2_status.yml"
   Credentials: ["Fortinet Device Access"]
   Survey: "check_vpn_phase2_status-survey.json"
   ```

### 4. Monitor and Audit
   - **View execution logs** in AAP web console
   - **Track job history** and success/failure rates
   - **Review connection logs** at `/tmp/fortinet_connections.log`
   - **Monitor credential usage** through AAP audit logs
